# EV3 PSO Path Planning Robot

![Robot in Action](assets/demo.gif)

## Overview
This project implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for autonomous path planning using LEGO Mindstorms EV3. The robot navigates a grid environment from (0,0) to (4,4) while avoiding obstacles using sensor data.

## Features
- Real-time path planning with PSO
- Dynamic obstacle detection and mapping
- Position tracking through odometry
- Visual feedback on EV3 screen

## Hardware Setup
- LEGO EV3 Brick
- 2 Large Motors (Ports B and C)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (Port 4)
- Differential drive chassis

## 🧩 System Architecture and Communication Flow

This section outlines the collaborative communication model between multiple EV3 robots and a central PC, which coordinates the **PSO process**.  
Each robot acts as a **particle in the swarm**, evaluating potential movements, while the server (PC) manages the optimization logic and termination conditions.

This bidirectional communication ensures each robot receives PSO updates and reports its evaluation results to the server.
